Trie
It is a search tree, which is specially used to store/search string in space/time efficient way.
In it, any node can store non-repetive multiple characters.
Also every node stores the link of the next character of the the string.
Also every node keeps a track of 'end of string'.

Why we need to learn Trie?
Used to solve many standard problems in efficient way:
	Speclling Checker
	Auto complete string
	etc.
	
Map
	char Trie node
	End of world Yes/No
	
	
Common Operations
Create 
Insert 
Search
Delete


Insert
	Case1: Trie is blank
	Case2: New string's prefix is common with another string's prefix
	Case3: New string's prefix is already present as complete string 
	Case4: String to be inserted is already present in Trie
	
Search
	Case1:String does not exist in Trie
	Case2:String does exist in Trie
	Case3:Current String is a prefix of another string but stirng does not exists in the trie.

Delete String(BCDE) from a trie:
	Case1:Some other word's prefix is same as Prefix of this word(BCDE,BCKG)
	Case2:This word is a prefix of some other word.(BCDE,BCDEF)
	Case3: Some other word is a prefix of this word.(BCDE,BC)
	Case4: No one is dependent on this word.(BCDE,K)

Practical Uses of Trie
AutoComplete
Specll Checker
